# Object_Detection
Welcome to the Object Detection Project! This repository contains a comprehensive implementation of an object detection system, designed to identify and classify multiple objects within an image or a video stream. The project leverages state-of-the-art deep learning algorithms and frameworks to achieve high accuracy and efficiency.
### Features
- Multiple Object Detection: Capable of detecting various objects simultaneously within an image or video.
- Real-time Processing: Optimized for real-time object detection in video streams.
- Pre-trained Models: Utilizes pre-trained models from popular frameworks like TensorFlow and PyTorch.
- Custom Training: Supports training custom object detection models on your own dataset.
- Visualization: Provides tools for visualizing detection results with bounding boxes and labels.

### Object Detection Algorithms
This project supports several popular object detection algorithms, including:

- YOLO (You Only Look Once): Real-time object detection system.
- SSD (Single Shot MultiBox Detector): Efficient and accurate object detection.
- Faster R-CNN (Region-based Convolutional Neural Networks): High accuracy object detection.

### Data Flow
- Input: Image or video stream is provided as input.
- Preprocessing: Input data is preprocessed to match the requirements of the model.
- Detection: The model processes the input data to detect objects.
- Post-processing: Detected objects are filtered and refined.
- Output: Detection results are visualized with bounding boxes and labels.
